# Metaphor CLI Tool

This repository contains a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for easy interaction with the Metaphor Data platform. The tool currently supports uploading data assets to your Metaphor Data instance.

## Features

* **Data Asset Uploads:** Upload data assets (knowledge cards) from a structured CSV file.

## Config file

The config file should include the following fields:

```yaml
config: <CONFIG>
tenant: <TENANT> # This is optional, only applicable to multi-tenant environments.
api_key: <API_KEY>
```

By default, `aesop` will look for `~/.aesop.yml`. You can provide a path to your config file via option `--config_file`.
